## Description

The project consists of a Python script (`1-square.py`) that defines a `Square` class. The `Square` class has a private instance attribute, `__size`, and is instantiated with a size value. The purpose is to showcase encapsulation and control over the `size` attribute.

## Files

- [1-square.py](1-square.py): Python script containing the implementation of the Square class.

## Usage

To use the Square class, you can create an instance by instantiating it with a size value. The provided script `1-main.py` demonstrates the usage:

```bash
./1-main.py
